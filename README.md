# Markov-based blockchain-related nonsense generator

Usage:

```
$ python main.py <num>
```

On startup, it will train a model based on every text file in the `corpus/` directory and then generate `<num>` sentences based on that model.

## Example sentences it can generate

* if alice wants to take back money through a strategy is done on top of its unstructured simplicity
* the cpu power law distribution with vastly more outputs, the second output value and notice that role of the difficulty, are much lower bound on creating a message is simply repeating the sender pays per day, but with bitcoin
* the longest proof-of-work chain of tree is that contains four out of turing-completeness is less than the script takes over a higher cost of a simplified method can be aware of a copy of a highly inefficient at all uncles
* a node collects new transactions before it are computationally impractical for example, implementing financial derivatives provide is kr/n since there are much like 1lw79wp5zbqahw1jl5tcibcrhqythaguwy
* each transaction type of digital tokens, on extending it does lead to allow for privacy, and transaction will automatically receive frequent payments without telling who provides the attacker
*  uncles included in the contract would be characterized as sub-currencies representing smart contracts, name to be processed by the merkle branch in this point, once the mint to 0
* the block, causing the wild, the block's hash of scalability feature set, but also be stored in implementing an alternate version of mining, let other contracts, gambling protocol on slightly more advanced features of speculators, political problem perfectly suited for some classes of a mechanism is the other use case is while there is a malicious user wants to natural disaster insurance
* we have an offer to store just by creating a transaction than the state tree should be characterized as of an economic human solution to exist for liquid democracy-style, generalizing the address field being linked to substantially more stable baseline
* new transactions depend on situations
* the sender of mediation increases nc; hence, all regular bitcoins, backtracking through the main choices in separate transaction system which runs an arbitrary cryptocurrency of work
* we predict that hashes of members would be either be possible to himself try to warrant their money system with one of the attacker
* they vote in other use this is more outputs, the protocol is defined as an attacker to encode any application
* even exist only businesses and sequentially applying it are very low development as part of fraud is to be aware of what some node's possession
anyone who wants to emerge
* since the proof of the payer not even exist and (2) the transaction until he's convinced he ought to me", essentially be implemented on regulated block b with one can be too weak, or multiple inputs and 0
